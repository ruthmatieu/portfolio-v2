                With a passion stemming from my introduction to MySpace (ðŸ¤£ sounds like eons ago) in 2008, I have been obsessed with 
                software technologies and curious to understand how it all works. Customizing my own MySpace profile taught me the 
                importance of having an engaging UI.

                Over the course of my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from simple 
                websites to complex web applications, using the latest frontend technologies and applying what I've learned over 
                the years. I place a strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork, working seamlessly with all aspects of the team 
                to deliver high-quality projects.
